# animal-quest
A basic game written in Python (3.9.1) with pygame for HACKNJIT 2021. The basis for the creation of the game was to introduce an educational value to be gained; to increase awareness of endangered wildlife and species. <br/> <br/>
In addition, the gameplay consists of a female character that is tasked with setting free animals while avoiding enemies (poachers) and completing tasks to advance through the level. Freeing animals displays a short message which states the conservation status of the speices as well as other knowledgeable info that can be used (Ex: donations for animal rescue organizations). <br/>
